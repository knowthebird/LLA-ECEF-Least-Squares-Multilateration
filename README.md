# LLA-ECEF-Least-Squares-Multilateration
Use least squares method and minimization with optional constraints to perform multilateration, to find latitude, longitude, altitude (LLA) from a collection of data points in LLA format, by converting them to ECEF.  Conversion can be skipped and ECEF data points used as well.
